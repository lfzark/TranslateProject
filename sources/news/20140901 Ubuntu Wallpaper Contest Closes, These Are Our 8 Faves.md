Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest Closes, These Are Our 8 Faves
Ubuntu壁纸大赛落幕,出现最受欢迎的8款壁纸
================================================================================
**Put your lens caps on, your stylus down, unplug your Wacom tablets and step away from the GIMP: the [Ubuntu 14.10 Wallpaper Contest][1] is now over.**
**盖上你的镜头，放下你的笔，拔掉手绘板的电源，从你的GIMP离开，[Ubuntu 14.10 壁纸大赛][1] 已经结束**
The biannual hunt for community contributed wallpapers to ship with the coming Ubuntu release always triggers a wave of excitement, enthusiasm and critical debate. *Too monotone! Too bright! Where are the plants? Y U NO CATS??!!*

With the deadline now…well, dead and underlined, no further submissions will be accepted.
随着终结时间的到来。。好吧，再次终结和强调，不再接收任何提交。

Over the coming week a judging panel made up of last year’s winning artists will sift through each entry in turn to select their faves. The **winning set of wallpapers is to be revealed on September 9, 2014**. 

### Our Favorites Means Just That: Ours ###

We trawled through [the almost 400 entries][2] to pick a few of our favourites. Like always, this was a ruddy difficult task! So much talent, such little room on the install disc…

**Disclaimer**: We are not part of the judging panel nor do we have any direct or indirect influence over the panel’s decision. Every submitted entry is viewed and judged by its own merits.
